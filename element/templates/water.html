                <p>Water is agile and gracefully moves around all obstacles. Just like water, I clean negative energies with my optimistic disposition. It takes a lot to shift my mood because I'm generally like a calm flowing river. I'm smooth and easy going, which some elements might take advantage of. Every now and then, I have to remind myself that it's okay to give the unappreciative ones my raging rapids. And when someone pushes me to the limit, I wouldn't hesitate to show them the wrath of my waterfall, even though it's not in my nature. I'll keep the good ones floating and wash the rest out to shore.</p>
