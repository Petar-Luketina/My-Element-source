                <p>Earth is tough and doesn't back down. My emotional stability rivals that of mountains. Like a snow-covered peek, I keep a cool head in difficult situations.

The other elements unanimously appreciate my levelheadedness much more than my power though. Consequently, I'll continue to use my cool head to guide the other elements to positive change.</p>
