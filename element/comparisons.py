    'Fire':
        'Fighting fire with fire only leaves the world in ashes. When dealing with another fire element, '
        'it’s best to keep your emotions checked because you may ignite the other flame. Fire elements often '
        'compete in who is brighter, hotter, or wilder. Contain your flame by looking past these games. '
        'You control your fire, not the other way around. Needlessly comparing yourself to others will burn '
        'you out. It’s not all fiery chaos and competition though. When two fire elements are together, their '
        'great passions can burn bright. If both elements can stand the heat, amusing unpredictability will '
        'always ensue.',

    'Earth':
        'Fire may burn the greenery on top of the earth, but it rarely damages the earth itself. Earth elements '
        'are tough, and don’t like to move, even when threatened with a fire. Hiding your flames and kindly '
        'convincing an earth element to step out of your path is best. Expect for their unwillingness or inaction '
        'though; if you become ignited with anger, there might be a rock slide coming your way.',

    'Water':
        'Water is the opposite of fire, which is a benefit for you. Constant heat within your emotions will '
        'burn you up quickly. The best relief is being around a water element who doesn\'t ignite your flames '
        'but rather extinguishes them. Keep water around you as much as possible. Remember that if you turn up the '
        'heat on a water element, they will turn into steam and slowly slip away from you. Take care of a water '
        'element, and they will keep you cool in return.',

    'Wind':
        'The wind greatly affects how a flame moves. A wind’s often gentle breeze will keep you from turning into a '
        'wildfire. Be mindful that although a wind element circulates positive energy, they have many ups and downs. '
        'If you’re up for a pleasant roller coaster ride, then keep wind elements by your side. Ride on their '
        'pleasant air currents to keep you emotionally high and happy too.',

    'Element': 'Earth',

    'Fire':
        'Fire has the potential to be a calming campfire placed on top of a few logs or a wildfire burning forests '
        'on the sides of mountains. It is best to take your wondrous mountain out of the way of uncontrolled '
        'flames. Only when the fire damages others, it is okay turn the flames into ashes. Befriending a fire '
        'element is smart too because it keeps the heat away from your side of the mountain. Just always keep the '
        'conversation light and non-confrontational.',

    'Earth':
        'Imagine two steady mountains standing next to each other. Both are mutually reliant on one another '
        'because one mountain can block the cold from hitting the other and vice versa. The two mountains’ '
        'stability will lead to an everlasting bond, even when the ground gets rocky. However, in rare cases, '
        'there might be a time when tectonic plates cause the two to split... The divide can be avoided if one '
        'mountain has the willingness to follow the other.',

    'Water':
        'Like rain coming down on a desert, water enriches the earth. A water element’s easy-going nature and '
        'stability work well with your personality. You must act as the soil around the riverbank and move the '
        'ground around the flow of water to keep their passions going. If you stand immovable like a dam to river, '
        'the water can spill over, or find another way around you. Keeping the water going and protected will '
        'benefit everyone.',

    'Wind':
        'Wind’s frantic movements can sometimes leave you exhausted, like wind eroding the side of a mountain. '
        'When a wind element is spinning around like a wild, yet good-intentioned tornado, it’s okay to remind '
        'them to breathe slowly. Even at their most frantic states, wind elements carry positive energy and '
        'comforting air. If you can keep the wind from blowing the rocks off your cliff, wind elements will always '
        'be reliable and eccentric counterparts. ',

    'Fire':
        'Fire may be the opposite of water, but that’s not a bad thing. The two elements balance each other out. When '
        'you gently flow like a river, fire will be there to push you out onto the riverbank. Fire elements tend to be '
        'less restrained than you so it’s okay to remind them of your reserved nature. Keep fire around to warm the '
        'water but make sure they never reach your boiling point. ',

    'Earth':
        'Earth either goes with water or stands against it. If there are earth elements that are against you, it’s '
        'best to do as a river does: Gracefully move around or over them. When you’re faced at the foot of a large '
        'mountain, generously ask the earth to move for you. Beautiful scenes can unfold when you two work together. '
        'Niagara Falls, Angel Falls, and Victoria Falls are a few examples of when earth helps lift water to great '
        'heights. Collaborate strategically and kindly with an earth element to keep flowing smoothly.',

    'Water':
        'Another water element will keep you flowing in the right direction. The easiest and most stable relationships '
        'are had by two water elements. This stability is extremely comforting but can also be limiting. If you seek '
        'variety from the consistency, you can always intermingle with the other elements. Find a good balance '
        'with the other water element to avoid a drought (too little) or flood (too much).',

    'Wind':
        'The ocean and sky are closely related because they both have a ’current’ and a ’flow’. Oceans are known for '
        'their consistent ebb and flow, while the sky’s patterns are sporadic. If you desire unexpected fun, then look '
        'to a wind element. They have a good energy, like water, but sometimes are brought down by their changing '
        'emotional state. Be prepared to deal with their rainy days and you’ll be generously rewarded with their sunny '
        'days.',

    'Fire':
        'Fire and wind share a constant changing emotional state. Sometimes fire will want to be confrontational with '
        'others, so gently showing them another path away from danger is needed. Their hot flames are occasionally '
        'helpful in your life though. Since you tend to go with the flow, you rarely want blow air in the opposite '
        'direction; fire will be there to support you by turning up the heat on your adversaries. Just make sure to '
        'send calming cool air towards them if the heat is coming your way.',

    'Earth':
        'Earth is the opposite of wind, which can help both elements. When you feel like you’re going too much with '
        'the '
        'flow of others, an earth element can help root you down; they tend to be stable like mountains. Sometimes you '
        'two will have trouble understanding each other since earth is firm and reserved while wind is accommodating '
        'and emotionally driven. Look past your difference to have a balanced energy. Remember to openly communicate '
        'your feelings and intentions since earth is your opposite, and they cannot relate to your shifts in weather.',

    'Water':
        'Water and wind work harmoniously with each other. When thinking of the two together, imagine boats with huge '
        'sails. Such crafts seamlessly tread over the water with the help of the wind. Both elements have a strong '
        'willingness to support others too. The combination of the two elements has helped people traveling across the '
        'seas for thousands of years. Look to water for completing any difficult project because their stability often '
        'keeps you from changing directions needlessly.',

    'Wind':
        'No other element combination has such enjoyable ups and downs as two wind elements. Both elements (should) '
        'understand the other’s fluctuating emotions well. When together, the weather might change often but it hardly '
        'ever turns into angry storms. You can enjoy the shared roller coaster ride with that peace of mind. If one '
        'wind element’s sad air is going South, the other is there to change the direction back North.',
